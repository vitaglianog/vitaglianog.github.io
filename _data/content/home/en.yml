  aboutme: "
  I am a (soon-to-graduate) Ph.D. student at the Information Systems Group lead by Prof. Felix Naumann at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.
  My research interests are on data preparation and information extraction, and I am most active at the intersection of machine learning and data management systems.
  Feel free to contact me for collaborations, research proposals, or anything closely or loosely related to these research interests.
  Being born right at the center of the Mediterranean Sea, I am a lover of sea, italian food, and espresso.
  The beautiful landscape above is from Monte Paipo in Italy, a hiking spot close to my hometown.
