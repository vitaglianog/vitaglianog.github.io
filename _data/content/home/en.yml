  aboutme: "
  I am a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, in the Data Systems Group.
  My goal is to make data accessible for all. I am passionate about data and I would like to make it easier for everyone to use it.
  I am working at the intersection of data management and artificial intelligence. The research areas I find exciting are multimodal question answering sytems, automating the design of complex data pipelines, and optimizing agentic and ML-based workloads.
  Feel free to contact me for collaborations, research proposals, or anything closely or loosely related to these research interests.
  Being born right at the center of the Mediterranean Sea, I am a lover of sea, italian food, and espresso.
  The beautiful landscape above is from Monte Paipo in Italy, a hiking spot close to my hometown.
