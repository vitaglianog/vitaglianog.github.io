<!-- outline-end -->

Together with [Ziyu Li](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/li) from TU Delft and [Carsten Binning](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/systems/systems_tuda/group/team_detail_18624.en.jsp) from TU Darmstadt, we are planning to organize the third edition of the workshop on Databases and Machine Learning (DBML). 
I am happy to share that our proposal was accepted and the DBML workshop will be co-hosted with ICDE 2024 in Utrecht, Netherlands. 
Stay tuned for more information!
